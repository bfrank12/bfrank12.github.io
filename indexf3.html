<h2>Heart of the Beast</h2>
    <p>The 2020 Yamaha MT-09 is powered by a sweet 847cc, DOHC, liquid-cooled, inline three-cylinder engine that is tuned for the type of low-end power that makes a hooligan bike so much fun to ride. The MT-09 engine utilizes Yamahaâ€™s Crossplane Crankshaft Concept which produces a linear torque delivery that is the trademark of the Hyper Naked lineup.</p>
