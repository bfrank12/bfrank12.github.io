<h1>GET NAKED!<br>
Yamaha's 2020 MT-09</h1>
    <h2>Hyper + Naked = Fun</h2>
<p>The MT-09 is the original Hyper Naked in Yamaha's not-so-secret society of aggressive-looking and fun-to-ride streetbikes. 
    From start to finish the MT-09 was designed around the rowdy 847cc triple with crossplane crank and a chassis that is very 
    accommodating for riders of all levels. Over the years the MT-09 has evolved into one of the best bangs for the buck in the 
    streetfighter or naked bike class.</p>

    <h2>What You Get:</h2><br>
    <ul>
    <li>The 2020 Yamaha MT-09 is powered by a sweet 847cc, DOHC, liquid-cooled, inline three-cylinder engine that is tuned for the type of low-end power that makes a hooligan bike so much fun to ride</li>
    <li>The control-filled cast aluminum frame features swoopy lines and the braced swingarm that incorporates a horizontal placement of the Monocross shock to create a responsive-handling chassis. </li>
    <li>A fully adjustable 41mm inverted fork along with a preload- and rebound-adjustable shock smooths out most back city roads and backcountry byways that you might run across during your travels.</li>
    <li>The MT-09 engine utilizes Yamahaâ€™s Crossplane Crankshaft Concept which produces a linear torque delivery that is the trademark of the Hyper Naked lineup.</li>
    <li>Traction Control also offers two modes plus the ability to be turned off completely. </li>
    <li>A variety of rider assist functions begins with the YCC-T controlled D-Mode throttle mapping that allows for two separate levels of throttle response to choose from. </li>
        <li>With its tapered aluminum handlebar, low seat height, relaxed footpeg placement, and narrow frame to fuel tank interface, the bike is comfortable to ride and the reach to the ground is easy for riders of all skill levels.</li></ul>

Start with feature_1 then copy the feature_2 and feature_3 subfolders from the demo into your local root folder so you can try out your hyperlinks. -->
